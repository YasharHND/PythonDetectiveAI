> **Detective**: Elena, you were the last one to see Mr. Caldwell alive. Tell me, what were you doing in his study earlier that evening?

> **Elena Rivers**: I was returning some overdue books to Mr. Caldwell's study.

> **Detective**: Did you notice anything unusual in the study, Elena? Anything out of place or perhaps an object that didn't belong?

> **Elena Rivers**: No, everything seemed normal.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, you mentioned being in the rare book section. Could you tell me which specific books you were reading that night?

> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I was engrossed in a collection of 18th-century historical manuscripts.

> **Detective**: Professor, you said you got that cut on your hand from a book. That's rather unusual, isn't it? Could you please show me the exact book that caused the injury?

> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: It was a very old book, with brittle pages and a sharp corner. It caught me by surprise as I was turning it. I'm sure I can find it again.

> **Detective**: Professor, while I examine this book, can you please describe the location of this book within the rare books section? Be as specific as possible.

> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: It was on the top shelf, near the back of the section. You'll know it by its worn leather binding and a faded inscription on the cover. It's one of the oldest books in the collection.

> **Detective**: Henry, you were seen leaving the library shortly before Mr. Caldwell's body was discovered. Can you tell me what brought you to the library at that late hour?

> **Henry Lang**: I went to the library to return a book I had borrowed.

> **Detective**: Henry, what book was it that you needed to return so urgently at that hour? Surely it could have waited until morning?

> **Henry Lang**: It was a book on local history. I needed to check a date for a business meeting I had the next morning.

> **Detective**: That's peculiar, Henry. The library records don't show you checking out any books on local history recently. Are you certain you returned it to the correct location?

> **Henry Lang**: I'm sure I checked out a local history book. I always do when researching my business dealings. Perhaps the record was misplaced.

### Result

> Professor Shaw, that cut on your hand doesn't appear to be caused by a book. It looks more like the result of a struggle. You were familiar with the layout of the library and Mr. Caldwell's routines, weren't you? You
> could have easily gotten access to the key hidden in his prized possession. Professor, I believe you are the one who murdered Mr. Caldwell.
