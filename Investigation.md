### Investigation:

> **Detective**: Elena, you were the last person to see Mr. Caldwell alive. What brought you to his study that evening?
> 
> **Elena Rivers**: I was there to return a book he had requested.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, you claim to have been in the rare book section. Can you tell me which specific book you were reading and what makes you remember it so clearly?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I was reading a first edition of "The Canterbury Tales" by Chaucer, a very well-worn copy with a beautiful inscription on the flyleaf.

> **Detective**: Henry, you were seen leaving the library shortly before Mr. Caldwell's body was discovered. What was your reason for being at the library so late, given your known disagreement with the victim?
> 
> **Henry Lang**: I was at the library to discuss a proposal for the library's expansion.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, you mentioned a well-worn copy of "The Canterbury Tales" with an inscription. Could you please describe the inscription to me?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I can't recall the exact wording, but it was a dedication to a former owner, possibly a family member. It was written in a beautiful, flowing script.

> **Detective**: Elena, you mentioned returning a book to Mr. Caldwell. Can you tell me which book it was?
> 
> **Elena Rivers**: It was a book on ancient Egyptian mythology.

> **Detective**: Henry, you said you were at the library to discuss a proposal. Did this proposal have anything to do with the land dispute you had with Mr. Caldwell?
> 
> **Henry Lang**: No, the proposal was for a new wing to house the growing collection of books.

> **Detective**: Elena, you had disagreements with Mr. Caldwell regarding the library's modernization. Did these disagreements ever escalate beyond professional arguments?
> 
> **Elena Rivers**: No, our disagreements were purely professional.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, you mentioned a cut on your hand, claiming you got it from a book. Could you please show me this book?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I don't have the book with me, but I'm sure it's still in the rare book section.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, I have examined the copy of "The Canterbury Tales" you mentioned. There are no loose pages or sharp edges that could have caused the cut on your hand. Care to explain this discrepancy?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I must have gotten the cut elsewhere. Perhaps while working in my garden earlier that day.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, your story has changed multiple times during this investigation. You were also found with an unexplained injury. This leads me to believe you are hiding something. Did you kill Mr. Caldwell?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I'm innocent. I wouldn't hurt a fly, let alone a dear friend like Mr. Caldwell.

> **Detective**: Professor Shaw, your alibi doesn't hold up. The injury on your hand, your changing story about the book, and your close proximity to the rare book section where Mr. Caldwell kept his valuable first editions all point to your guilt. You knew about the hidden key in the book on ancient locks and keys.  You used that key to lock the study from the inside after killing Mr. Caldwell, didn't you?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: I wouldn't know anything about any hidden key. I don't even remember what book I was looking at that night. The library is such a labyrinth, I'm sure I just got lost in the stacks.

> **Detective**: You claim to be forgetful, yet you could vividly describe a non-existent inscription in detail. It seems your memory is selective, Professor. You killed Mr. Caldwell to get your hands on his valuable first-edition collection, didn't you?
> 
> **Professor Gregory Shaw**: My memory is just... faulty. The inscription wasn't on "The Canterbury Tales." I must have been thinking of another book.  I have no idea why you would think I'd kill someone over a collection of books.

### Investigation Result

> Professor Shaw, your attempts to deflect blame are futile.  All the evidence points to you.  You are under arrest for the murder of Mr. Caldwell.
