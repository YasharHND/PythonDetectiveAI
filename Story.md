# Title: The Silent Library

### Setting:

> In a small, isolated town nestled in the mountains, there stood an old, grand library known as the Bramblewood Library.
> It was a quiet place, where only the sound of pages turning could be heard.
> The library had been run by an elderly man, Mr. Adrian Caldwell, for over 40 years.
> One cold winter night, Mr. Caldwell was found dead in his study, a locked room within the library.
> There was no sign of forced entry, and the only way in or out was the door, which was locked from the inside.

### Suspects:

> 1. Elena Rivers - A young and ambitious librarian, who recently started working at the Bramblewood Library.
>    She was eager to modernize the library and often clashed with Mr. Caldwell over his old-fashioned ways.
>    She was the last person seen entering Mr. Caldwell’s study earlier that evening.
>
>
> 2. Professor Gregory Shaw - A retired professor of history, a frequent visitor of the library, and a close friend of Mr. Caldwell.
     He often spent hours in the library researching for his upcoming book. That night, he claimed to have been in the library’s rare book section,
     far from the study. However, he was found with a cut on his hand, which he said he got from a book.
>
>
> 3. Henry Lang - A local businessman and a member of the library’s board, who had a hidden past.
     He had a significant disagreement with Mr. Caldwell over a piece of land the library owned, which Henry wanted to buy. Mr. Caldwell refused,
     and the tension between them had been growing for months. Henry was seen leaving the library shortly before the discovery of the body.

### The Hidden Clue:

> The library was home to a rare and valuable collection of first-edition books. Among them was a book Mr. Caldwell kept in his study,
> a prized possession that he never allowed anyone to touch. It was a book on ancient locks and keys,
> which had a hidden compartment inside the spine containing a small key.
